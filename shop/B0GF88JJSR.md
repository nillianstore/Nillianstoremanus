Get hooked faster with **LYYP FISHING’s Pre-Tied Offset Hooks** the go-to choice for UAE anglers targeting bass, panfish, and trout with precision and ease. Each pack includes three expertly hand-tied size 12 offset (J-style) hooks on 5.0kg nylon line (7.0kg test), so you skip the knot-tying and start catching from the first cast at Al Qudra or desert oases.

Paired with a **multi-ground sharp tip** and **reverse needle point**, these hooks deliver instant penetration and rock-solid retention, even in high-temperature conditions that challenge standard tackle.

Reinforced with a **flat shank** and meticulously wrapped threads, these rigs handle strong pulls without snapping making them ideal for both novice anglers in Dubai and seasoned pros in Ras Al Khaimah.
