Fish smarter, not harder with **LYYP FISHING’s Pre-Tied Circle Hooks** engineered for UAE anglers who demand efficiency and reliability on the water. Each pack delivers three professionally hand-tied size 12 circle hooks, pre-rigged on 5.0kg nylon line with a 7.0kg test capacity, so you spend less time tying knots and more time reeling in carp, bass, and bream from Al Qudra Lakes or desert reservoirs.

The **circle hook design** ensures safer, more ethical catches by hooking fish in the corner of the mouth perfect for catch-and-release practices common among Emirati fishing communities. Its **multi-ground sharp tip** and **reverse needle point** guarantee instant penetration and zero drop-offs, even in high-heat conditions that weaken standard tackle.

Built with a **flat shank** and reinforced hand-tied wraps, these rigs withstand the pull of powerful freshwater species without fraying or breaking. Whether you’re a weekend angler in Abu Dhabi or a competitive carp hunter in Sharjah, LYYP delivers tournament-grade performance straight out of the blue package.
